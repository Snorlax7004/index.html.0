<!-- Description about me   -->

    <p>My name is <strong>Dalinska Garcia</strong>. And I'm a Freshman majoring in <u>Chemical Engineering</u>.  <br/>
    The reason why I choose this major is because I've always been <em>interested</em> in chemistry and math 
    when I was younger. <br/> Also, because of the salary.

    </p>  
    
    <br/>
    
    <p> The first job that I worked at when I was in high school was at a bakery.
     I was worked as a baker and a cake decorator.  <br/>I really enjoyed working because I was able to  
     gain experience in my communication skills and team work. <br/> And I was able to eat a lot of
     sweets!!!
